1. **run all code** Runs all code on the page (same as typing *ctrl+shift+enter)
2. **upload to gallery** upload a sketch to Hydra's gallery and create a shorter URL
3. **clear all** resets the environment and clears text from the editor
4. **show random sketch**. Loads random sketch examples. Always it is a good way to learn Hydra by studying someone elses code.
5. **make random change** **dices** modify values automatically. Try it with some of the sketch examples.
6. **show info window** show overlay window with help text and links

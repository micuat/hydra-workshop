Loie Fuller, an American dancer, produced dance performances with an extended skirt in the 1890s before the introduction of electronic media. Oskar Schlemmer at Bauhaus produced Staebetanz (literally, stick dance), attaching white long sticks on a dark costume to represent the body as lines in the 1920s.

[Merce by Merce by Paik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV6iS-K7wOw) (1978) is the first videodance piece created by Merce Cunningham, Charles Atlas, Nam June Paik and Shigeko Kubota. The choreography is made specifically for the screen not for the stage as narrated as follows:

> At Lincoln Center in 1965, he was the first to combine dance with video, foreshadowing a new art form that has become known as videodance. ... Choreographed especially for the TV screen and supervised in every detail by Mr Cunningham.

The notion of using digital media for theater culminated with the rise of the Japanese collective Dumb Type founded in 1984.

Some artists took a challenge to connect such multimodal experiences to networked spaces: I Move In Decades (2011) by Ellen Pearlman, which combines audiovisual streaming via Skype and motion tracking among Hong Kong, Canada and New Zealand. Collective projects Distant Feeling(s) and Distant Movements (2015-) by Annie Abrahams, Lisa Parra, Daniel Pinheiro, and Muriel Piqué are experimental networked performances on a video conference platform (Zoom) that are open to public and guide participants to contemplate or move together while eyes closed for 15 minutes, resulting in a collective somatic experience.

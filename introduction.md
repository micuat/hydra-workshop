Introduction
========





There are a few resources besides this book:

* [The new official documentation](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/docs/#/) is a good resource to get started,
* [Hydra Functions](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/functions/) is an interactive webpage to see functions and its usages,
* [Hydra Garden](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/garden/) is a place for inspirations,
* and while not updated anymore, [Hydra Patterns on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hydra_patterns) is a way to find sketches from other artists.

Loie Fuller, an American dancer, produced dance performances with an extended skirt in the 1890s before the introduction of electronic media. Oskar Schlemmer at Bauhaus produced Staebetanz (literally, stick dance), attaching white long sticks on a dark costume to represent the body as lines in the 1920s.

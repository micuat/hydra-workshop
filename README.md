# Hydra Workshop

## Preface

Hydra is an analog-synth-like coding environment for real-time visuals. It is created by Olivia Jack and is [open-source](https://github.com/hydra-synth). You can simply open [Hydra editor](https://hydra.ojack.xyz) to start coding.

Here is a list of things that I would like you to bring:

- laptop (windows, mac, or linux) and power adapter
- props to work with - it can be anything, but if you need inspiration, here's a video of a workshop I did last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ7RQ9wTC5Y
- webcam (if you have one)
